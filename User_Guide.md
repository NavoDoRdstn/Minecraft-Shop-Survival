# Instructions on how to use the world sharing system
If you think you might need help later or have poor memory, keep this document open while you're busy doung stuff.

Step 1: Go here. Congratulations.

You have two options from here for messing with world files, although only one is covered in this guide.


#The Guide, simplified
This option is the simplest, both for me and for you. It involves uploading the world file directly to the github cloud storage thingy.

1. Above the list of files in this repository is a button labeled, "Upload Files". Clicking it will bring you to a page in which you can either open up you computer's file explorer or just drag-and-drop files in. Add the Minecraft world file.
1.5: It's probably simple enough to understand, but just for safety, you are uploading the World file in Minecraft's Save directory. DM me if you somehow need help finding said file.
