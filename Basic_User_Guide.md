# Instructions on how to use the world sharing system
If you think you might need help later or have poor memory, keep this document open while you're busy doing stuff. If you somehow have any questions, feel free to DM me.

The small prerequesite to uploading worlds and using this entire system is to have a Github account, so I can add you as a collaborator.

#Uploading Worlds
After every session on the world, whether it be on the server or clientside, you'll want to upload the world file so other people can see and interact with your changes.

1. Above the list of files in this repository is a button labeled, "Upload Files". Clicking it will bring you to a page in which you can either open up you computer's file explorer or just drag-and-drop files in. Add the Minecraft world folder; this may take a while. If you're extra cool, you can also zip the world folder to make it easier on everybody, although it's not a requirement if you don't know how to do so.

2. If done correctly, you should see the name of the world pop up under the drag-and-drop canvas. It's not necessary, but it would help to title your file upload and when it was uploaded in the title box below, just for logistics's sake. DO NOT play around with the checkboxes(dots?) for committing to the Master Branch or creating a new branch; we'll leave options like that to our Advanced Guide. We'll want to click the big green "Commit Changes" button now.

4. Github will now take a second(a while) to upload the world. As far as I can tell, you're free to do whatever at this point, including close the tab while it's working. The world has finished uploading, and you're done.


#Downloading Worlds
To actually make use of a world file, you'll have to download it from this Github repository.

1. Find the most recent version of the world and click it. I think Github adds the most recent files to the top of the file list, but just in case, you should use the upload dates of the files to find it.

2. There should be a Download button: Obviously, hit it to download the world. Don't bother deleting the file or anything else fancy, I'll take care of that.

3. Add the World folder you just downloaded to the Saves directory in your Minecraft folder. For zipped worlds, don't forget to unzip the file beforehand. If you boot up Minecraft, then, Viola(a large string instrument) it should show up as a world! Now you can mess around in it to your heart's content.

For advanced things like adding backups/world states or taking over admin duties from poor Chris, read the advanced guide. And remember, if you have any questions, DM me.
