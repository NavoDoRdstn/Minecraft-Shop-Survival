# Instructions on how to use the world sharing system
If you think you might need help later or have poor memory, keep this document open while you're busy doung stuff.

Step 1: Go here. Congratulations.

You have two options from here for messing with world files, although only one is covered in this guide.


#Uploading Worlds
After every session on the world, whether it be on the server or clientside, you'll want to upload the world file so other people can see and interact with your changes.

1. Above the list of files in this repository is a button labeled, "Upload Files". Clicking it will bring you to a page in which you can either open up you computer's file explorer or just drag-and-drop files in. Add the Minecraft world file.

2. If done correctly, you should see the name of the world pop up under the drag-and-drop canvas. Below that, you'll see what looks like a speech bubble coming from your profile pic, with two empty spaces for an optional title/desription. It's not necessary, but it would help to title your file upload and when it was uploaded in the title box, just for logistics's sake. 

3. DO NOT play around with the checkboxes(dots?) for committing to the Master Branch or creating a new branch; we'll leave options like that to our Advanced Guide. We'll want to click the big green "Commit Changes" button now.

4. Github will now take a second to upload all the world. The world has finished uploading, and you're done.


#Downloading Worlds
To actually make use of a world file, you'll have to download it from this Github repository.
